## Installing the Nx AI Manager

Nx supports the Videology SCAiLX camera. If your SCAiLX Zoom Block camera didn't come preinstalled with our Nx AI Manager (previously Scailable) runtime, don't worry. Just follow our installation documentation [here](https://nx.docs.scailable.net/nx-ai-manager/get-started-with-the-nx-ai-manager-plugin).

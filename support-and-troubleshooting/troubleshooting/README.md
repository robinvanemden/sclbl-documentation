# Troubleshooting

## Is it a problem in the AI manager

This troubleshooting section will only help with the Nx AI Manager and does not address other problems in the Nx Meta or Nx EVOS system.

When you are troubleshooting you need to make sure that you are trying to use AI with the AI Manager and not another function of Nx EVOS, the Nx AI Manager is different than the built in motion detection for example.

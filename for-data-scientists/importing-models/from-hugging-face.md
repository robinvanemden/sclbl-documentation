![](../../.gitbook/assets/hugging-face-vector-logo.png)

> Hugging Face, Inc. is a French-American company headquartered in New York City, specializing in the development of computer tools for building applications using machine learning. Renowned for its transformers library tailored for natural language processing (NLP) applications, the company also offers a platform enabling users to share machine learning models and datasets while showcasing their work.

Despite Hugging Face focusing mostly on NLP models based on the transformers architecture, they are also providing support for image classficatin models in their [timm](https://huggingface.co/docs/timm/en/index) library, and some object object detection models in the [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) library.

### Deploying Hugging Face models

As stated previously, our interest is focused only on vision models not NLP models, and specifically image classification and object detection models.

To deploy an image classification model, check out the [Common Models](common-models.md) guides.

# 2. Install NX AI Manager plugin

If your installation of the Nx Server did not come packaged with the NXAI Plugin, you can always install it yourself.

Navigate to a terminal window on the device where you installed the Nx Server and execute the following:

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(wget -q -O - https://artifactory.nxvms.dev/artifactory/nxai_open/NXAIPlugin/install.sh)"
```

This script will download the latest plugin and place it in the appropriate plugin folder. The Nx Server will need to be restarted before the plugin is loaded.

This installation script will prompt if it should attempt to restart the server to load the plugin. If you choose not to restart the server now, it can be [restarted](../support-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting/controlling-the-server-and-the-plugin.md#restarting-the-server) later.

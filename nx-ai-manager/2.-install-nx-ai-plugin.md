# 2. Install NX AI Plugin

If your installation of the Nx Mediaserver did not come packaged with the NXAI Plugin, you can always install it yourself.

{% hint style="info" %}
Installing the NX AI Plugin will restart the Nx Mediaserver. This should take a couple of seconds, and the client will reconnect automatically.
{% endhint %}

Navigate to a terminal window on the device where you installed the Nx Mediaserver and execute the following:

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(wget -q -O - https://artifactory.nxvms.dev/artifactory/nxai_open/NXAIPlugin/install.sh)"
```

This script will download the latest plugin and place it in the appropriate plugin folder.&#x20;

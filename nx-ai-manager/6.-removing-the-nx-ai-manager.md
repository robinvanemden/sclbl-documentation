# 6. Removing the Nx AI Manager

## Uninstalling the Nx AI Manager

It might be desired to remove the Nx AI Manager installation, due to a corrupted install or if you want to reinstall the Nx AI Manager with a different acceleration library.

The AI Manaer can be removed by simply deleting the folder, assuming default installation:

`sudo rm -r /opt/networkoptix-metavms/mediaserver/bin/plugins/nxai_plugin/nxai_manager`

When the mediaserver is restarted, the plugin will reinstall the Nx AI Manager.

## Removing the Nx AI plugin

{% hint style="info" %}
Removing the Nx AI Plugin can lead to the Nx Mediaserver crashing if it is in use.
{% endhint %}

For added safety, disable the plugin on all devices on the server before removing. This is not full-proof, however, and could still lead to crashes. The only fully safe method of removing the plugin would be to first stop the mediaserver:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop networkoptix-metavms-mediaserver.service
```

To remove the Nx AI plugin from your Nx Meta server, log in to the server console and execute the following command:

```bash
sudo rm -r /opt/networkoptix-metavms/mediaserver/bin/plugins/nxai_plugin
```

If you stopped the mediaserver, it is now safe to restart it:

```bash
sudo systemctl start networkoptix-metavms-mediaserver.service
```

## Restarting the Nx Meta mediaserver

After uninstalling the Nx plugin and AI manager, [restart](../support-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting/controlling-the-server-and-the-plugin.md) the Nx mediaserver for these changes to take effect.

Please refer to Nx documentation for Nx Meta mediaserver uninstallation instructions
